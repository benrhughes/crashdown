Put any images, videos, PDFs, javascript files etc in this directory (in any directory structure you like).

You can then reference them with the url <domain>/uploads/filename. Eg if you have created a folder /var/www/mysite/uploads/documents/pdfs/ and have a file call about.pdf in it, the URL will be <domain>/uplods/documents/pdfs/about.pdf
